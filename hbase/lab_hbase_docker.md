# HBase Docker Lab

## Prerequisites

Before you run the lab make sure you have cloned the following Git repositories. 

- [Bigdata Docker Infrastructure](https://github.com/sgioldasis/bigdata-docker-infra)
- [Bigdata Course Labs](https://github.com/sgioldasis/bigdata-course-labs)

If you don't have git you can click the above links, click on the green `Code` button and choose `Download ZIP`. You then need to unzip into your home folder (`~`). 

Alternatively, if you have `git` installed you can just open a terminal and run the following:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sgioldasis/bigdata-docker-infra.git
git clone https://github.com/sgioldasis/bigdata-course-labs.git
```

> NOTE: If you cloned into a different folder than your home folder then you have to adjust the commands below replacing `~` with the path to the folder you have chosen.

## Startup

Before you run the lab make sure the infrastructure is running. To do that open a terminal and run the following:

```
cd ~/bigdata-docker-infra/demo
./run-all-services.sh
```

## Enable Web HDFS download to localhost

In order to enable Web HDFS download to localhost, you need to perform some extra steps. Open a new terminal and type:

```
docker inspect datanode | grep -E '("IPAddress"|"Hostname")' 
```

This will give you the `Hostname` and `IPAddress` of the datanode container. For example:

```
"Hostname": "5f35cd4f78be",
            "IPAddress": "",
                    "IPAddress": "172.19.0.5",

```

You then need to edit the file `/etc/hosts`:

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add one line containing the `Hostname` and `IPAddress` you found above:

```
172.19.0.5 5f35cd4f78be
```

Save the file and you are ready to go.


## Get a prompt inside the container

Now, you need to connect to the running `hbase-master` container. Type the following in your terminal:

```
docker exec -it hbase-master bash
```

You will notice the command prompt will change (eg. `root@60280d2557bf:/opt#`). Now you can run the commands for each task described below.

# How to Process Data with Apache HBase

Inside the `hbase-master` container you can start an hbase shell:
    
```
hbase shell
```

Inside the hbase shell you can run the following commands:

## General Commands

- Show the status of the system including the details of the servers running on the system.

    ```
    status
    ```

- Show the version of HBase used in your system.
    ```
    version
    ```

- Show a guide on how to use table-referenced commands
    ```
    table_help
    ```

- Show the current HBase user
    ```
    whoami
    ```

## Creating a Table

You can create a table using the create command. Here you must specify the table name and the Column Family name. The syntax to create a table in HBase shell is shown below.

> `create '<table name>','<column family>'`

- Create the `emp` table
    ```
    create 'emp', 'personal data', 'professional data'
    ```

- List the existing tables
    ```
    list
    ```

## Enabling/Disabling a Table

To delete a table or change its settings, you need to first disable the table using the disable command. You can re-enable it using the enable command.

- Disable the `emp` table
    ```
    disable 'emp'
    ```

> NOTE:  After disabling the table, you can still sense its existence through list and exists commands but you cannot scan it. If you try: `scan 'emp'` it will give you the following error: `ERROR: emp is disabled.`


- You can also check whether a table is disabled:

    ```
    is_disabled 'emp'
    ```

- Finally, you can re-enable the table:

    ```
    enable 'emp'
    ```

## Manipulating a Table

- Show the description of the `emp` table

    ```
    describe 'emp'
    ```

- Change the maximum number of cells of a column family:

    ```
    alter 'emp', NAME => 'personal data', VERSIONS => 5
    ```

- Add a column family:

    ```
    alter 'emp', 'newcf'
    ```

- Delete a column family:

    ```
    alter 'emp', 'delete' => 'newcf'
    ```

- Verify the existence of a table:

    ```
    exists 'emp'
    ```

- Delete/Drop a table (before dropping a table, you have to disable it)

    ```
    disable 'emp'
    drop 'emp'
    ```

- Disable, drop and recreate a table (truncate)

    ```
    truncate 'emp'
    ```

## Inserting Data

Using the `put` command, you can insert rows into a table. Its syntax is as follows:


> `put '<table name>', 'row1','<colfamily:colname>', '<value>'`


- Insert the first row values into the emp table:

    ```
    put 'emp','1','personal data:name','Savas'
    put 'emp','1','personal data:city','Athens'
    put 'emp','1','professional data:designation','manager'
    put 'emp','1','professional data:salary','50000'

    put 'emp','2','personal data:name','George'
    put 'emp','2','personal data:city','Thessaloniki'
    put 'emp','2','professional data:designation','team lead'
    put 'emp','2','professional data:salary','40000'

    put 'emp','3','personal data:name','Nick'
    put 'emp','3','personal data:city','Patra'
    put 'emp','3','professional data:designation','junior developer'
    put 'emp','3','professional data:salary','30000'

    ```

- Verify the data was inserted:

    ```
    scan 'emp'
    ```

## Updating Data

You can also update the table using the `put` command above. Try it:

- Update the salary for employee 1:

    ```
    put 'emp','1','professional data:salary','60000'
    ```

- Verify the data was updated:

    ```
    scan 'emp'
    ```

## Reading data

We already saw examples of the `scan` command. Using the `get` command, you can get a single row of data at a time. Its syntax is as follows:

> `get '<table name>', 'row1'`

- Read the row for employee 1:

    ```
    get 'emp', '1'
    ```

Below is the syntax to read a specific column using the get method:

> `get 'table name', 'rowid', {COLUMN â‡’ 'column family:column name'}`

- Read the name of employee 1:

    ```
    get 'emp', '1', {COLUMN => 'personal data:name'}
    ```

## Deleting a Specific Cell in a Table

Using the delete command, you can delete a specific cell in a table. The syntax of delete command is as follows:

> `delete '<table name>', '<row>', '<column name>', '<time stamp>'`


- Read the city of employee 1:

    ```
    delete 'emp', '1', 'personal data:city'
    ```

Using the `deleteall` command, you can delete all the cells in a row. Given below is the syntax of `deleteall` command:

> `deleteall '<table name>', '<row>'`

- Delete employee 1:

    ```
    deleteall 'emp', '1'
    ```

- Verify by counting the number of rows after the operation:

    ```
    count 'emp'
    ```



## Cleanup

To cleanup type the following:


- Exit the hbase shell:
        
    ```
    exit
    ```

- Exit the hbase container:
        
    ```
    exit
    ```

- Shutdown all containers:

    ```
    cd ~/bigdata-docker-infra/demo
    ./stop-all-services.sh
    ```

- Verify

    ```
    docker ps -a
    ```
